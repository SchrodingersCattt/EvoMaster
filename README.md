## <a id="introduction"></a>📖 Introduction

**EvoMaster** is a lightweight yet powerful framework designed to enable researchers and developers to rapidly build their own scientific agents.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, applying them to complex scientific domains often requires intricate engineering—managing tools, skills, memory, and multi-agent coordination. EvoMaster bridges this gap. It provides a highly compatible and extensible infrastructure that abstracts away the complexity, allowing you to focus on the scientific problem at hand.

Whether you are building a chemist agent to plan synthesis paths or a biologist agent to analyze proteins, EvoMaster serves as the foundational infrastructure for the next generation of scientific discovery.

## <a id="key-features"></a>✨ Key Features

### 1. ♾️ Universal Compatibility

EvoMaster is built to play well with others. It supports and adapts to the mainstream technologies defining the current Agent landscape.

* **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Seamlessly manage interactions between multiple agents.
* **Tool Usage & Skills:** Native support for [MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) tool calling and dynamic [skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

### 2. ⚡ Rapid Development

Complexity shouldn't be a barrier to innovation. EvoMaster is designed for portability and ease of use.

* **Minimal Boilerplate:** Spin up a custom agent with **just ~100 lines of code**.
* **Modular Design:** Plug-and-play components allow for quick customization without rewriting core logic.

### 3. 🔬 The SciMaster Ecosystem

Don't start from scratch. EvoMaster grants you immediate access to state-of-the-art scientific agents and allows you to apply their architectures to new domains.

* **Out-of-the-box Access:** Quickly deploy agents from the **[SciMaster](https://scimaster.bohrium.com/chat/)** series.
* **Domain Adaptation:** Easily retarget successful SciMaster series agents from to other scientific fields such as Biology, Material Science, etc.
