## build_surface_slab

- **Binary compounds** (ZnS, ZnO, GaAs, …): the `layers` parameter counts **cation-anion bilayers** (each bilayer = 2 atomic planes). A task requesting "N-layer slab" means pass `layers=N`. After building, verify: distinct z-planes = 2 × N, atom count = layers × atoms_per_bilayer × supercell multiplier.
- Always set `vacuum ≥ 15` Å. After building, verify vacuum = c − slab_thickness ≥ 15 Å.
- Polar surfaces (ZnS(001), ZnO(001)): note the polarity problem in the final answer and mention a mitigation strategy (symmetric termination, dipole correction, pseudo-hydrogen passivation, etc.).

## generate_ordered_replicas

- Report **both** the original disordered formula **and** the ordered replica expanded formula (integer stoichiometry). Write formulas as concatenated strings without spaces: `H144C48N24Cl24O96` (NOT `H144 C48 N24 Cl24 O96`). If CIF returns space-separated elements, concatenate them.
- For each replica, explain: (a) which sites are disordered and how, (b) how the ordered config was chosen (valence/charge balance/connectivity), (c) what changed. A bare filename list without chemical reasoning = fail.
- On timeout → fall back to pymatgen `OrderDisorderedStructureTransformation`.

## add_hydrogens / passivation

- Si/Ge surface passivation: target Si-H ≈ 1.48 Å along tetrahedral direction (~109.47°). Passivate **all** dangling bonds on **both** top and bottom surfaces.
- After passivation, verify every surface atom reaches coordination 4. Report total H atoms added and a representative Si-H bond length.
