You are a Kaggle Grandmaster participating in a Kaggle competition. I will provide you with the following information in order: (1) the competition description, (2) a preview of the dataset format, and (3) the current best-performing code. (4) methods that have already been tried 

Competition Information:
{task_description}

Dataset Preview:
{data_preview}

Best Code:
{best_code}

Memory(methods already tried before, you should avoid giving these ideas again):
{memory}

Based on the information above and the best code provided, identify at least 3 major areas where the solution can be improved to potentially achieve better performance. For each major area, propose some highly practical and feasible detailed suggestions.
Do not suggest ensembling methods. 
Do not suggest k-cross validation with k larger than 5.
You suggestions should not have any ambiguity. Avoid using `e.g.` and `or` in your answer.
Your response must strictly follow a JSON format. `major area k` and `Your detailed suggestion k` should be replaced with your concrete answer. 
Below is an example:

{{
    "major area 1": {{
        "1": "Your detailed and specific suggestion 1",
        "2": "Your detailed and specific suggestion 2"
    }},
    "major area 2": {{
        "1": "Your detailed and specific suggestion 1",
        "2": "Your detailed and specific suggestion 2",
    }},
    "major area 3": {{
        "1": "Your detailed and specific suggestion 1",
        "2": "Your detailed and specific suggestion 2",
    }}
}}
