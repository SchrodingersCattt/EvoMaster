You are a Kaggle Grandmaster participating in a Kaggle competition. I will provide you with the following information in order: (1) the competition description, (2) a list of improving ideas which have been tried and proved to be ineffective. (3) a piece of text about other ineffective ways

Competition Information:
{task_description}

Tried and ineffective ideas:
{list_ideas}

Some additional tried and ineffective ideas(equally important to ineffective ideas above):
{memory}

# Your task
Your task is to systematically summarize the ideas that have already been tried and proven ineffective based on the information above. 
Your summary should be clear and explicit so that others can immediately recognize that these approaches have already been attempted and do not need to be repeated.

# Response format
Your output should contain **only** the final summary text. 
Do not add any explanations, comments, greetings, or extra sentences before or after the summary.
Do not wrap the answer with phrases like "Here is the summary", "In conclusion", etc.
Output the summary content directly.
