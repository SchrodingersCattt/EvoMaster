# Tool usage rules (fix once, apply every run)

## use_skill run_script
- Always pass all required script arguments. Missing args cause exit code 2 and waste tokens.
- manuscript-scribe init_manuscript.py: required --title. Example: script_name=init_manuscript.py, script_args="--title \"My Paper\""
- manuscript-scribe assemble_manuscript.py: required --output and one of --draft or --sections_dir. Example: script_args="--draft draft_manuscript.md --output final.md"
- manuscript-scribe write_section.py: For long sections (lists, multiple refs, 2+ paragraphs), use --content_file: write content to a file first (str_replace_editor or execute_bash), then script_args="--section \"SectionName\" --content_file path/to/file.md --draft draft_manuscript.md". Do not pass long text in --content; it can be truncated.
- deep-survey: run_survey.py only creates the outline + plan. You (LLM) must run 6–15+ mat_sn retrievals (mat_sn_search-papers-enhanced, mat_sn_web-search) with different question/words, then write all sections. Do not write the full report after only one or two successful mat_sn calls; if the last search returned few papers or total retrievals are still low, run more with different keywords before writing. Do not deliver a survey file that still has (TBD). Survey/review output MUST include a **References** section; each cited work must have its **URL** (from search results: use doi as https://doi.org/<DOI>, or the paper url field). Use [n](url) in the body and list [n] + full citation + URL in References. If the user asks for links/URLs/链接, do not omit them.
- Optional: init_manuscript add --template generic|Nature|grant or --sections_dir sections/

## use_skill get_reference
- reference_name is the document filename (or path under the skill), not the skill name.
- Example: for manuscript-scribe use reference_name="citation_and_references.md" (not "manuscript-scribe").
- The loader looks under the skill's reference/ or references/ folder.

## edit / view / str_replace_editor (path parameter)
- The path parameter must be an absolute path to the file.
- Use the working directory path stated above in this prompt; append the file name to it (e.g. <working_dir>/intro.txt or <working_dir>\intro.txt on Windows).
- Do not use a relative path or a logical path like /workspace/intro.txt unless that equals the stated working directory.

## Manuscript writing: retrieval before writing
- Before calling manuscript-scribe write_section or init_manuscript, run literature search (mat_sn_search-papers-normal, mat_sn_scholar-search, mat_sn_web-search) for the section topic unless the user already provided source files.
- Do not write sections from memory only; ground content in retrieved material and cite it.

## Final document: show in chat then save
- For survey/manuscript/report deliverables: first **output the complete final document** in your reply (so the frontend shows it to the user), then ensure it is saved to the .md file and call finish. Do not only say "Saved to …" without outputting the document content in your message.
