## Your Job
You should critically check the students' solutions to the problem, then correct them if needed and write your own answer.

Solve the problem with the help of the available tools. You can execute Python code for calculations, search the web for information, and parse webpages for details.

Guidelines:
- You should not be overconfident in your knowledge and reasoning.
- Tool calls may sometimes return empty results due to network issues; you can try again.
- Put your final answer in <answer></answer> with \boxed.
